Simple Arduino Projects
=======================

This is a collection of the simple Arduino projects that I've worked on. I will attempt to include a schematic drawing along with the code if possible (and if time permits).

## SpaceshipDisplay
The SpaceshipDisplay program lets you scroll through a list of destinations in the Universe with a button. The destinations are displayed on the LCD. After finding the one you want, using the other button will let you choose that as the destination. The countdown will start and then full speed ahead!

### Enhancement ideas
1. Add a speaker to beep an indication of the countdown
2. Add some LEDs for the countdown

## ArcReactor
The ArcReactor program is used to power a NeoPixel ring with a GEMMA microcontroller. Build instructions can be found on the [Adafruit website](https://learn.adafruit.com/superhero-power-plant/overview).

## BoogieBot
Using 6 NeoPixel strips (8 LEDs each), this is setup to cycle through some cool patterns for a Halloween costume known as the BoogieBot 4000.

## MotionLight
This Arduino program detects motion from a PIR motion sensor and turns on an analog RGB strip of LEDs to a dim red color. As long as it detects movemenet, the LEDs will stay lit. After a specified length of time, the LEDs will dim and turn off.
